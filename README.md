# CS_4381_PDF_Editor
This program is a program specifically tailored for the PDF powerpoints made by Prof Paulk. It trims the
PDFs and consolidate it all into one PowerPoint. It is currently a set trim amount because trimming
dynamically is not within my skill level.
### This program will consolidate all PDF within the folder it is currently in so be warned. But will not delete those PDFs

## How to install
If you're on a windows, click on the releases section on the right side of the page and download the latest file named `main.exe`.

If you're on a Mac or Linux, click on the green code button and download as zip. Unzip it and open a terminal at the location of the file and
type in `chmod +x main.exe` to give yourself permission to execute it and type `./main.py` to execute the program.

Make sure to put the executable in a different folder with just the PDF files. It should create a folder named `data` and in the folder should be a pdf named `result.pdf`
